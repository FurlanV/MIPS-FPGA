# MIPS-FPGA
 synthesis of a simplified version of the MIPS data path using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The FPGA is a programmable logic device that supports the implementation of digital circuits. Its configuration is usually specified using a hardware description language (HDL), in which case it will be done in Verilog
